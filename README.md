Howdy! My name is Colin Loudan and I am a dedicated, passionate, and results-focused cybersecurity and computer science student at Texas A&M University, where I am pursuing a Master of Computer Science.

My experience spans various projects and roles, including developing a modern and engaging website for the Texas A&M Water Ski Team, a restaurant POS and inventory management system, an electrocardiogram data client-server application, a Chrome extension for academic networking, and an AI public speaking aid. These projects have honed my skills in web development, database management, version control, computer networking, data visualization, and full-stack development.

In addition to my technical expertise, I was also involved in the Professional Brotherhood of Engineers, where I led a committee in organizing daily study sessions and participated in monthly community service projects like Habitat for Humanity. As a member of the Texas A&M Water Ski Team, I also balanced my technical pursuits with athletic activities.

My skill set includes Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, SQL, R, Git, Linux, Unix, Windows, Bash, Agile, AWS, SEO, and much more! I am also a student pilot, certified scuba diver, Eagle Scout, and have interests in backpacking, tennis, trombone, golf, football, fencing, and sailing.

I am eager to leverage my technical skills, leadership experience, and passion for software engineering, cybersecurity, and web development in a professional setting, contributing to innovative solutions and advancing the fields of software engineering, cybersecurity, and web development. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with diverse teams, tackling complex challenges, and making a meaningful impact in any role I undertake. Please feel free to email me at colincloudan@gmail.com!
