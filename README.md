Howdy! My name is Colin Loudan and I am a dedicated, passionate, and results-focused cybersecurity and computer science student at Texas A&M University, where I am pursuing both a Master of Engineering in Cybersecurity and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in cybersecurity.

My experience spans various projects and roles, including developing a modern and engaging website for the Texas A&M Water Ski Team, designing a virtual Y86-64 processor, developing an electrocardiogram data client-server application, and leading a team to create a weather data graphing tool. These projects have honed my skills in web development, processor simulation, computer networking, data visualization, and full-stack development.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am actively involved in the Texas A&M Cybersecurity Club, where I am working towards earning my CCNA certification, and the Professional Brotherhood of Engineers, where I participate in weekly professional workshops, lead a committee in organizing daily study sessions, and partake in monthly community service projects. As a member of the Texas A&M Water Ski Team, I balance my technical pursuits with athletic activities.

My skill set includes Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, R, Git, Linux, Windows, Unix, Bash, Agile, AWS, SEO, and much more! I am also a student pilot, certified scuba diver, Eagle Scout, and have interests in backpacking, tennis, golf, football, sailing, and community service.

I am eager to leverage my technical skills, leadership experience, and passion for software engineering, cybersecurity, and web development in a professional setting, contributing to innovative solutions and advancing the fields of software engineering, cybersecurity, and web development. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with diverse teams, tackling complex challenges, and making a meaningful impact in any role I undertake.
